## Near-Term (Next 1-3 Months)

### 1. **Full Payment Integration**
-   **Description**: Implement a full checkout and subscription management flow using a payment provider like Stripe. This includes creating checkout sessions, handling webhooks to update user plans in Firestore, and building a customer portal for users to manage their subscriptions.
-   **User Value**: Enables the application to operate as a real SaaS business.

### 2. **Enhanced AI Content Editing**
-   **Description**: Instead of just editing a single block of text, provide a more granular editing experience. The AI could provide multiple suggestions for a single bullet point, allowing the user to pick the one they like best.
-   **User Value**: Gives users more fine-grained control over the AI's suggestions and improves the collaborative feel of the tool.

### 3. **Expanded Template Library**
-   **Description**: Commission or design a wider variety of professional resume templates, targeting more specific industries (e.g., academia, creative fields, trades) and styles (e.g., minimalist, infographic).
-   **User Value**: Provides more choices for users to find a template that perfectly matches their personal brand and industry.

## Mid-Term (Next 3-6 Months)

### 1. **Cover Letter Generation**
-   **Description**: Add a new feature to generate a tailored cover letter based on the user's enhanced resume and a specific job description. The AI would synthesize the user's experience and the job's requirements to create a compelling narrative.
-   **User Value**: Saves users significant time and effort in the job application process and provides a high-quality, relevant cover letter.

### 2. **Mock Interview Simulator**
-   **Description**: Create a new tool where users can practice their interview skills. The AI would act as the interviewer, asking relevant questions based on the user's resume and the target job description. It could provide feedback on the user's answers.
-   **User Value**: Helps users build confidence and prepare for real interviews in a low-stress environment.

### 3. **LinkedIn Profile Optimization**
-   **Description**: Allow users to import their LinkedIn profile data and receive AI-powered suggestions for improving their headline, summary, and experience sections to attract recruiters.
-   **User Value**: Extends the value of the application beyond the resume to other critical parts of a modern job search.

## Long-Term (6+ Months)

### 1. **Career Path Suggestions**
-   **Description**: Based on a user's resume and stated interests, the AI could suggest potential career paths, identify skill gaps for those paths, and recommend courses or certifications to bridge those gaps.
-   **User Value**: Transforms the tool from a resume builder into a long-term career development partner.

### 2. **Multi-Language Support**
-   **Description**: Internationalize the application UI and train the AI models to provide resume analysis and enhancement in other languages (e.g., Spanish, French, German).
-   **User Value**: Opens the application to a global market.

### 3. **Team & Enterprise Features**
-   **Description**: Build features for career centers, universities, or outplacement services. This could include a central dashboard for coaches to review their clients' resumes, manage user accounts, and track progress.
