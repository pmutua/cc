---

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Core UI (Initial Commit - Step 10)**

-   **Project Scaffolding**: Initialized a new Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI.
-   **Core Layout**: Built the primary application layout, including the multi-step wizard (`Stepper`) and placeholders for each stage of the resume-building process.
-   **Component Creation**: Developed foundational UI components like `ResumeStep`, `JobDescriptionStep`, and the main `ResultsPanel`.
-   **State Management**: Implemented the initial client-side state management using React hooks to control the flow of the multi-step wizard.
-   **File Parsing Logic**: Integrated `pdf.js` and `mammoth` to enable client-side parsing of `.pdf` and `.docx` files, a key privacy feature.

### **Phase 2: Firebase & User Authentication (Steps 11-20)**

-   **Firebase Integration**: Configured and connected the application to a Firebase project.
-   **Authentication**: Implemented a secure sign-in flow using Firebase Authentication with the Google provider.
-   **User Context (`useUser` Hook)**: Created the `useUser` hook, the central piece for managing user state. This included:
    -   Listening to `onAuthStateChanged` to get the current user.
    -   Creating and managing user documents in Firestore.
    -   Setting up real-time Firestore snapshots to keep client-side user data in sync with the database.
-   **Protected Routes**: Implemented an `AuthGuard` to protect application routes from unauthenticated access.
-   **UI Polish**: Developed the `UserNav` component for displaying user information and providing a sign-out mechanism.

### **Phase 3: AI Integration with Genkit (Steps 21-30)**

-   **Genkit Setup**: Integrated Genkit into the project and configured it to use the Google Gemini model.
-   **Core AI Flow (`reviewAndImprove`)**:
    -   Developed the most complex and critical AI flow, `reviewAndImprove`.
    -   Used Zod schemas to define a robust, structured output for the AI, including scores, analysis, and the rewritten resume.
    -   Exposed the flow as a Next.js Server Action for type-safe invocation from the client.
-   **Supporting AI Flows**: Built out a suite of smaller, focused flows:
    -   `extractJobDescriptionFromUrl`: For scraping job postings.
    -   `generateResumeSection`: For providing suggestions in the Guided Builder.
    -   `generateCoverLetter`: For drafting tailored cover letters.
-   **AI Credit System**: Implemented the logic for the AI credit system, including the `AI_CREDIT_COSTS` definition and the `decrementCredits` function in the `useUser` hook.

### **Phase 4: Feature Completion & Refinement (Steps 31-45)**

-   **Guided Resume Builder**: Fully implemented the UI and logic for the `GuidedBuilder` component, connecting it to the `generateResumeSection` AI flow.
-   **Template Engine**:
    -   Created a library of professional resume templates as React components.
    -   Implemented the template selection UI in the `ResultsPanel`.
    -   Developed the `generateTemplateResume` flow to have the AI re-format resume content specifically for a chosen template's structure.
    -   Integrated `react-to-print` for high-quality PDF exports.
-   **Cover Letter UI**: Built the UI for the cover letter generator, allowing users to select a tone and view the AI-generated output.
-   **Admin Dashboard**: Created a dashboard for administrators to view (mock) user analytics and plan distribution.
-   **Payment Webhook**: Implemented a secure Paystack webhook endpoint (`/api/paystack/webhook`) to handle subscription updates from the server-side, a critical security feature.

### **Phase 5: Content, Polish & Documentation (Steps 46-Present)**

-   **Content Pages**: Created and polished content for all public-facing pages:
    -   Home, About, FAQ, Contact, Pricing, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Responsible AI.
-   **Pre-Launch Strategy**: Defined and implemented the "Early Access Program," updating the UI and `useUser` hook to provide free, extensive access to all users.
-   **Error Handling & Bug Fixes**: Addressed several issues, including Next.js image optimization errors and HTML hydration errors, to stabilize the application.
-   **Comprehensive Documentation**:
    -   Generated a full `docs/` directory with detailed information on architecture, setup, and features.
    -   Created a professional, public-facing `README.md`.
    -   Wrote a detailed, Medium-ready blog post (`blog-firebase-studio.md`) explaining the development process.
-   **Final Polish**: Replaced all placeholder images and icons with final assets to create a polished, production-ready user experience.
