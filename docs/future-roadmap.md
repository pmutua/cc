# CareerCraft AI - Future Roadmap

This document outlines a potential roadmap for future features and enhancements for the CareerCraft AI application. It is divided into near-term, mid-term, and long-term goals.

---

## Near-Term (Next 1-3 Months)

### 1. **Full Payment Integration**
-   **Description**: The application is already set up with a Paystack integration, including a secure webhook. The next step is to transition away from the "Early Access" model by building a full checkout and subscription management flow. This includes creating checkout sessions and a customer portal where users can manage their subscriptions.
-   **User Value**: Enables the application to operate as a real SaaS business and offer tiered pricing.

### 2. **Enhanced AI Content Editing**
-   **Description**: Instead of just editing a single block of text, provide a more granular editing experience. The AI could provide multiple suggestions for a single bullet point, allowing the user to pick the one they like best. This would involve a new, more focused Genkit flow.
-   **User Value**: Gives users more fine-grained control over the AI's suggestions and improves the collaborative feel of the tool.

### 3. **Expanded Template Library**
-   **Description**: Commission or design a wider variety of professional resume templates, targeting more specific industries (e.g., academia, creative fields, trades) and styles (e.g., minimalist, infographic).
-   **User Value**: Provides more choices for users to find a template that perfectly matches their personal brand and industry.

## Mid-Term (Next 3-6 Months)

### 1. **Mock Interview Simulator**
-   **Description**: Create a new tool where users can practice their interview skills. The AI would act as the interviewer, asking relevant questions based on the user's resume and the target job description. It could provide feedback on the user's answers.
-   **User Value**: Helps users build confidence and prepare for real interviews in a low-stress environment.

### 2. **LinkedIn Profile Optimization**
-   **Description**: Allow users to import their LinkedIn profile data and receive AI-powered suggestions for improving their headline, summary, and experience sections to attract recruiters.
-   **User Value**: Extends the value of the application beyond the resume to other critical parts of a modern job search.

### 3. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**
-   **Description**: Enhance the existing admin dashboard to provide more detailed analytics on feature usage, user retention, and conversion rates. This would involve more sophisticated data aggregation using Firebase Cloud Functions.
-   **User Value**: Provides the business with deeper insights into user behavior to make data-driven product decisions.

## Long-Term (6+ Months)

### 1. **Career Path Suggestions**
-   **Description**: Based on a user's resume and stated interests, the AI could suggest potential career paths, identify skill gaps for those paths, and recommend courses or certifications to bridge those gaps.
-   **User Value**: Transforms the tool from a resume builder into a long-term career development partner.

### 2. **Multi-Language Support**
-   **Description**: Internationalize the application UI and train the AI models to provide resume analysis and enhancement in other languages (e.g., Spanish, French, German).
-   **User Value**: Opens the application to a global market.

### 3. **Team & Enterprise Features**
-   **Description**: Build features for career centers, universities, or outplacement services. This could include a central dashboard for coaches to review their clients' resumes, manage user accounts, and track progress.
-   **User Value**: Creates a new B2B revenue stream and expands the application's market reach.
