# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. What is the "Early Access Program"?
During our Early Access phase, all users get generous daily AI credits to use every feature for free, including premium ones like the cover letter generator. This is a limited-time offer for our foundational users. In return, your feedback helps us improve the platform.

### 2. How does the AI improve my resume?
Our AI, powered by Google's Gemini model, performs a comprehensive analysis. It doesn't just fix grammar; it rewrites your content using stronger action verbs, quantifies your achievements to show impact, and analyzes it against a specific job description to identify keyword gaps and improve your resume's score.

### 3. What is the Guided Resume Builder?
If you don't have a resume or want to start fresh, the Guided Builder is for you. It's a step-by-step form that walks you through creating each section of your resume. You can ask our AI for suggestions for any section, helping you overcome writer's block and create compelling content from scratch.

### 4. What is an ATS and why is the score important?
ATS stands for Applicant Tracking System. It's software used by most companies to automatically screen resumes. If an ATS can't read your resume or doesn't find the right keywords, your application is often rejected before a human ever sees it. Our ATS score helps you optimize your resume to pass these digital gatekeepers.

### 5. How do you handle my data and privacy?
We take your privacy very seriously.
-   Resume files (`.pdf`, `.docx`) are parsed locally in your browser and are **never uploaded to our servers**.
-   The text content you provide is sent to our AI partner (Google) for processing but is not used to train their models or for any other purpose.
-   For more details, please see our full [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

### 6. Will I have to pay when the Early Access period ends?
No, you will not be automatically charged. We will notify all Early Access members well in advance before we introduce paid plans. As a thank you for your early support, you will be offered a special lifetime discount.

### 7. Why am I seeing a "Firebase not configured" error?
This means the application is not connected to a backend. To run the app locally, you need to create a Firebase project and add your configuration keys to a `.env` file at the root of the project. Please follow the **[Setup Guide](./setup.md)** for detailed instructions.
