# CareerCraft AI - Responsible AI Policy

**Effective Date:** October 28, 2023

## 1. Our Commitment

At CareerCraft AI, our mission is to empower job seekers. We are committed to developing and deploying artificial intelligence responsibly, with a focus on fairness, transparency, and accountability. This policy outlines the principles that guide our use of AI to ensure it serves our users' best interests while mitigating potential risks.

## 2. Core Principles

Our AI development and deployment are guided by the following core principles:

### a. Fairness and Non-Discrimination
-   **Goal**: To build an AI system that provides equitable and impartial assistance to all users, regardless of their background.
-   **Commitment**: We are actively working to mitigate and avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias. Our AI is explicitly instructed not to make judgments based on protected characteristics such as age, gender, race, ethnicity, religion, or disability. We recognize that resume and hiring data can contain historical biases, and we are committed to continuous monitoring and improvement to counteract these.

### b. Transparency and Explainability
-   **Goal**: To ensure users understand when they are interacting with an AI and have insight into how it works.
-   **Commitment**: We will clearly label features that are powered by AI. We strive to make our AI's recommendations understandable, though the complexity of large language models means we cannot always explain the precise reasoning for every suggestion. We provide users with the AI's analysis (e.g., keyword gaps, ATS score) to offer context for its outputs.

### c. Human Agency and Oversight
-   **Goal**: To design AI systems that augment, rather than replace, human judgment.
-   **Commitment**: CareerCraft AI is a tool to assist, not to decide. The user is always in control. All AI-generated content is presented as a suggestion that the user can review, edit, or discard. We encourage all users to critically evaluate AI suggestions and use their own judgment to craft their final resume. We have implemented clear in-app disclaimers to reinforce this principle.

### d. Privacy and Data Governance
-   **Goal**: To protect user data and be transparent about its use.
-   **Commitment**: We treat all user data, especially the content of resumes, with the utmost care. Our Privacy Policy provides detailed information about what data we collect and how it is used. We explicitly disclose when data, such as resume text, is sent to our third-party AI service providers (e.g., Google's Gemini models) for processing. We do not use personal resume content to train our own models without explicit, opt-in consent.

### e. Accountability and Responsibility
-   **Goal**: To take responsibility for the operation of our AI systems and provide mechanisms for feedback.
-   **Commitment**: We are accountable for the performance and impact of our AI. We have established clear feedback channels, including a "Leave Feedback" link in our application, for users to report issues, biased outputs, or other concerns. This feedback is regularly reviewed to improve the safety and effectiveness of our models.

## 3. How We Implement These Principles

-   **Prompt Engineering**: We design our prompts (the instructions given to the AI) to include specific constraints that guide the model toward fair and unbiased outputs.
-   **In-App Disclaimers**: We place clear disclaimers next to AI-generated content to remind users of its nature and the importance of their own review.
-   **User Control**: The application is designed to give users full control over their final documents. All AI output is editable.
-   **Feedback Mechanisms**: We actively solicit user feedback to identify and address any issues with our AI's performance.
-   **Policy Review**: This policy is a living document. We will review and update it regularly as AI technology and best practices evolve.
