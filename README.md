## üöÄ Motivation

The job application process can feel like a black hole. Talented candidates are often overlooked not because they lack skills, but because their resumes fail to communicate their value effectively or pass through automated screening systems (ATS). I built CareerCraft AI to solve this problem by providing job seekers with an intelligent assistant to create a truly compelling, professional, and optimized resume.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Multi-Format Resume Parsing**: Upload `.pdf`, `.docx`, or `.txt` files, or simply paste text. All parsing is done securely in the browser.
-   **Guided Resume Builder**: Don't have a resume? Create one from scratch with a step-by-step wizard and get AI-powered suggestions for every section.
-   **AI-Powered Comprehensive Review**: Get a holistic analysis of your resume, including an overall quality score, key recommendations, and content analysis for grammar, tone, and impact.
-   **Job-Specific Optimization**: Paste a job description URL to get a "Job Match Score," identify keyword gaps, and receive suggestions to tailor your resume for a specific role.
-   **ATS Readiness Optimization**: Understand how an Applicant Tracking System sees your resume and get an ATS compatibility score with actionable advice.
-   **AI Cover Letter Generation**: Generate a tailored cover letter draft in seconds based on your enhanced resume and the target job description.
-   **Professional Template Library & PDF Export**: Choose from a library of professionally designed, ATS-friendly templates and export your final resume as a polished PDF.
